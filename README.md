# About

This repo contains some of the source code used to demonstrate interoperability for:

- [DHS SVIP Raw Material Import Tracking Using Blockchain - Phase 1 Award](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2019/11/08/news-release-dhs-awards-198k-raw-material-import-tracking)

## Future Changes

The following websites were at one time powered by this code base:

- https://wallet.interop.transmute.world/
- https://issuer.interop.transmute.world/
- https://verifier.interop.transmute.world/

Moving forward, we will be closing the source code behind these websites, in order to apply them to a wider range of use cases. This archive serves as the last release of their source under Apache-2.0.
